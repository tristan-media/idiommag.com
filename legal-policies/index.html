<ol>
<li>Identify the material and its prior location on our website.</li>
<li>Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address.</li>
<li>Include a statement that you believe, under penalty of perjury, that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>

<li>Sign the document.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the DMCA, we may reinstate the material in response to a proper counter-notification. Please note that you could be liable for damages (including costs and attorney&#8217;s fees) if you knowingly misrepresent that material is not infringing the copyrights of others.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Data Collected</h3>
<h4>Personal Data</h4>
<p>Personal data, also known as personally identifying information, identifies a specific individual, for example by name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to our e-mail list, you will receive announcements of events. The list is administered by a vendor, MailChimp. According to its <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/page/privacy/">privacy policy</a>, PLI does not sell or unnecessarily disclose personal data to third parties.</p>
<p>Each announcement sent to subscribers will have a link in the message allowing you to update your personal data or to unsubscribe from the list. If you forward the message, the recipient(s) will not be added to the list. If you click on a link in the message, your e-mail address (and optional data) will be disclosed to us. We nonetheless will use that data only in the aggregate, such as to track the popularity of certain exhibits.</p>
<h4>Non-Personal Data</h4>
<p>Your web browser provides certain non-personal data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, to our server, so that it knows where to send the webpage you requested. Our web server may also collect the URL (&#8220;web address&#8221;) of the website that you arrived from. While it might be possible to correlate this data with an individual, we do not do so. We use it in the aggregate, to study and improve how our website is used, to diagnose technical problems, and to maintain system security.</p>
<p>When you visit parts of our website, our web server sets a &#8220;cookie&#8221; (places it on the hard drive of your computer). A cookie is a string of alphanumeric text that identifies the computer that was used to visit a particular webpage. This cookie does not personally identify you. If you are a client, then a second cookie is set when you log in, to allow you to administer your website. You can configure your web browser to disable cookies, but doing so may impair your use of our website.</p>
<p>We use an advertising network to place third-party ads on our website. Clicking on those ads will set cookies, to which we do not have access, nor do we know which ad a visitor clicked on. These cookies do not identify individual visitors to our website or to the linked websites. We also use web statistics services to monitor certain pages of our website and RSS feeds for the purpose of reporting website and RSS traffic, statistics, advertisement &#8220;click-throughs,&#8221; and other activities on our website. When authorized by us, these services may use cookies, web beacons, and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about visitors to our website. No personal data is collected by or transferred to these networks. For more information on how data is collected and used, please see their privacy policies:</p>
